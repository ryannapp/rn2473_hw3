## Homework 3

## Group Members:
- Ryan Napolitano - rn2473
- Jason Herrera - jjh2210

## How to run:
- Run solution.py at the command line with no arguments.

- Solution .py assumes the Brown corpus is available at data/brown.txt

- It will create a directory called "models" if it does not already exist and will save the trained models to this directory.

- It will also create a directory called "results" if it does not already exist and it will save the results of the evaluation there as a csv file with headers.
